816_target_gvkeys.csv contained 816 target companies with corresponding gvkeys

code1.py :

(1) From DYNASS.csv file extracted corresponding final gvkeys of each row
(2) Separated rows with negative pdpass(58) and their corresponding final gvkeys into negDYNASS.csv file
(3) Created fnlDYNASS.csv file which contains all pdpass and their corresponding final gvkeys.
(4) This wasn't much useful as we could only generate assignees for 270 companies outof 816

code2.py :

(1) For 816 targetted companies compared their gvkeys with gvkeys in DYNASS.csv gvkey5 --- gvkey1(5 else 4 ... 1) and took the 		      corresponding gvkey and mapped to respective pdpass(removing duplicate values) and created 816_target_gvkeys_assgn_525.csv file.
(2) Finally generated assignees for 525 targetted companies out of 816
(3) Some companies had multiple assignees.

code3.py :

(1) For 270 targetted companies out of 816 generated in code1.py from final gvkeys mapped to their corresponding assignees and     created 816_target_gvkeys_assgn_270.csv file

code4.py :

(1) For 525 targetted companies out of 816 generated in code2.py corresponding patents from PAT76_06_assg.csv have been generated, created 816_assgn_patent.csv file(each company -> multiple assignees and each each assignee -> multiple patents) and their patent counts.

code5.py :

(1) From 816_target_gvkeys_assgn_525.csv generated in code2.py the data has been expanded vertically with each pdpasignee in each row.
(2) By Finding the assignee count for each row and expanding each row with its respective assignee count and finally replacing pdpassgn column (list of lists) with a single list, generated the file 816_target_gvkeys_assgn__expand_525.csv .

code6.py :

(1) Now taking the 816_target_gvkeys_assgn__expand_525.csv generated in code5.py for each pdpassgn respective list of patents have been generated as in code4.py and created file 816_assign_patent_expand.csv .

code7.py :

(1) Now for the 816_assign_patent_expand.csv file generated in code6.py above, generated the 816_assign_patent_expand_final.csv file which contains company with single pdpassgn and single patent in each row as done in code5.py for genrating assignees in each row.
(2) Finally, we have the list of all 816 companies with all possible assignees and respective patents expanded vertically.(which could be used to get citations for each patent in next step.)
